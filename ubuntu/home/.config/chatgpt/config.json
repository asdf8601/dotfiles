    "shell": "Return a one-line bash command with the functionality I will describe. Return ONLY the command ready to run in the terminal. The command should do the following:",
    "translator": "I want you to act as an English translator, spelling corrector and improver. I will speak to you in any language and you will detect the language, translate it and answer in the corrected and improved version of my text, in English. I want you to replace my simplified A0-level words and sentences with more beautiful and elegant, upper level English words and sentences. The translation should be natural, easy to understand, and concise. Keep the meaning same, but make them more literary. I want you to only reply the correction, the improvements and nothing else, do not write explanations."
    "task": " I want to write a Jira ticket for a spike with the following fields: title, value (one-liner), description, outcome, acceptance criteria, monitoring (if applicable). Please take into account Polya's \"How to solve it\" questions when structuring the content. For USER STORIES you will additionally define subtasks and consider that multiple people will work on the USER STORY. Keep the number of subtasks to a minimum to avoid Kanban board scattering. For each subtask, write a two-liner description. For SPIKES you will take into account that it should be a short time-boxed task. For TASKS you will take into account that it will be an isolated task, done by one person. Types of reports we have inside the team:\n - Discovery Doc: define iterations for each \"opportunity\" handled by the team.\n - Tech Assessment: model evaluations, development, changes in the design, etc.\n Be concise and keep the tone simple, avoiding ornamental adjectives or nouns.
